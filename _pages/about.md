I'm a second-year PhD at McGill University and MILA, supervised by Joelle Pineau. I do research on generative modeling and continual learning. 

I'm currently interning at FAIR Montréal, where I did work on adapting learned compression methods to the online non-iid setting. Right now I, along with a bunch of smart(er) people from FAIR, McGill and Doctors in Montreal / NY, am doing research on COVID-19.

I like sports, cats, exploring the Montreal restaurant scene, and most of all enjoying some time off filling up my personal battery for the next conference deadline. I'll buy you a beer if you can beat my at a game of [spikeball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo4qTH-VYGM).
